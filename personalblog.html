             <h1>#RAPNERDSUNITE</h1>
            <p>In late August of 2013, my professor for my Communications on Internet course assigned every student to create a blog and maintain it as a class assignment. I was very excited to do it, because I've always wanted to start a rap blog but never got around to doing so. Now I have the opportunity to not only make a new hobby, but to do it correctly and possibly make it into a small business. The most beneficial thing that I got out of my Wordpress blog was it reminded me how much I love Rap music. Balancing my busy school schedule and my social life can be not only frustrating, but stressful and difficult. I find forcing myself to sit down, write a post about the latest news in the hip-hop world is very therapeutic and enjoyable. The most relaxing parts of my semester is sitting in my bed and ranting about the thing I am the most passionate about. This is probably the one creation during the entire 2013 year that I am the most proud of! I know that might seem sad, but to me it's a lot that I hope I can turn into everything! </p>
