             <h1>#RAPNERDSUNITE</h1>
            <p>In late August of 2013, my professor for my Communications on Internet course assigned every student to maintain a blog as class project. I was very excited to do it, because I've always wanted to start a rap blog, but never got around to doing so. I plan on taking advantage of it and not only make a new hobby, but to do it professionally and make it into a small business. The most beneficial thing I got out of my Wordpress blog was it was a reminder of how much I loved music. Balancing my busy school schedule and my social life can be not only stressful and difficult.  Forcing myself to sit down, write a post about the latest news in the hip-hop world is very therapeutic and enjoyable. The most relaxing parts of my semester are the moments when I'm sitting in bed and ranting about the thing I am the most passionate about. This is probably the one creation of 2013 that I am the most proud of! I know that might sound corny, but to me it's a lot, and I hope one day I can turn it into everything! </p>
