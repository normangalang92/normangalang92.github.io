             <h1>Allow me introduce myself...</h1> 
<p>Hello world! My name is Norman Brian Galang. I am a 21-year-old University of Florida student living in Gainesville, FL who is majoring in Journalism & Communications. I am currently a junior and I love my classes and the program that I am in. I feel truly blessed to be at a university where it seems everyone is nice, personable, helpful and as happy to be where they are as I am.</p>
            <p>I fell in love with writing when I realized that not only was I good at it, but it was a challenging and fun way to express my thoughts and what I love. And one of the things I love and the most passionate about is the Hip-Hop culture. I truly believe I can write about anything as long as I can conduct research and you give me the time. But rap has always been something that I had no problem expressing.</p>
            <p>Ever since I can remember, Hip-Hop music has always been the background or soundtrack to my childhood even until this day. I hope to one day work for one of the big online Hip-Hop publications like Complex, XXL, VladTV and Hip Hop DX.</p>
            <p>My dream job is to one day interview rappers, discuss rap-related topics and eventually work in a record label and manage artists myself. I love Hip-Hop and I am glad that I found a major that would allow me to enter the music industry and have a career!</p>
