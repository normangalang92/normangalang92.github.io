             <h1>Allow me introduce myself...</h1> 
            <p>Hello world! My name is Norman Brian Galang and I am a University of Florida student who is majoring in Journalism & Communications. I am currently a junior and I love my classes and the program that I am in. I feel truly blessed to be at a university where everyone is nice, personable, helpful and happy to be where they are as I am too.</p>
            <p> I fell in love with writing when I realized that not only was I good at it, but it was a challenging but fun way to express my thoughts and what I love. And one of the things i love and most passionate about is the Hip-Hop culture. I truely believe I can write about anything as long as I have a little bit of thought and research behind it, but Rap has always been something that I had no problem expressing.</p>
            <p>Ever since I can remember Hip-Hop music has always been the background or soundtrack to my childhood even until this day. I hope to one day work for one of the big online Hip-Hop publications like Complex, XXL, VladTV and Hip Hop DX.</p>
            <p>My dream job is to one day interview rappers, discuss rap-related topics and eventually work in a working record label and manage artists myself. I love Hip-Hop and I am glad that I found a major that would allow me to enter the music industry and have a career!</p>
