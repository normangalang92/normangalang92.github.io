             <h1>Short-Term Goals</h1> 
            <p>Currently one of my main immediate goals is to find an internship for either an online or local newspaper or magazine publication. I would like to step my foot into the industry and apply the skills that I have learned from school into the real world and challenge myself.</p>
   
             <h2>Long-Term Goals</h2> 
            <p>After I graduate with my Bachelors Degree, I hope to maintain and build up my personal website and blog to where it becomes a part of me and possibly something that I could use as more than just a reference, but become its own brand. Hoping that my website and blog get bigger and gain more followers, I hope to work for some of the biggest online Hip-Hop publications. I believe with my help, companies would like and appreciate my ideas and creative perspective on things. Not only do I have an extensive knowledge of the rap culture, but I would like to think I am very business minded when the opportunity presents itself. </p>
