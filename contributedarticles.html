            <h1>Contributed Articles / Interviews</h1> 
            <p>The biggest interview I have conducted to this day was with the CEO and co-founder of one of my favorite hip-hop record labels, Damien Ritter of Funk Volume. Home of hardcore rappers: Hopsin, SwizZz, Jarren Benton and Dizzy Wright, along with producer DJ Hoppa.</p>
            <p>Funk Volume is one of the biggest underground rap record labels in the genre. What I like about these artists is that they are diverse, honest, creative, original and lyrically amazing when it comes to their musical styles. Exactly what hip-hop is all about and been about. Each artist on the label has their own identity and sound, but share the same loyal die-hard fans.</p>
            <p>For my Communications on Internet class, I was required to interview one professional in the business that I wish to be in, and I chose to speak to someone at Funk Volume. I sent in an e-mail explaining that I am a University of Florida student in the Journalism program and plan to create an audio interview with someone who is a staple in the underground rap scene and part of the independent music business. And Funk Volume was the first name that came to my mind. Dame Ritter, the CEO & co-founder of the label, was awesome and down-to-earth enough to allow me to speak to him, it was an honor!! If Dame is reading this, I appreciate your time and I'm proud to see where Funk Volume started to where it is now!! #STILLMOVIN.</p>

<p>You can listen to my very nervous, but amazing interview with Dame below.</p>

            <p>My first real taste of music journalism was writing album reviews and interviewing rappers for an underground hip-hop website called <a href="http://www.faygoluvers.net" target="_blank"> Faygoluvers Heaven</a>. I was around 15-years-old when I started writing track-by-track album reviews to promote the albums I loved, which I turned into a semi-professional hobby. I started interviewing my favorite rappers from the independent hip-hop world because I believe I can come up with great in-depth questions that all fans would be wondering and would want to know as well. I also looked up to these artists a lot growing up so it was a pleasure for me to talk to them for 30 minutes to an hour about their music. It all began on a forum called Horrorcore.com, a message board where fans of the underground horrorcore rap genre could meet and discuss music. Unfortunately, the site shut down several years ago, but luckily while I was posting on that forum I began sending my articles to Faygoluvers. You can find a few of my pieces below.</p>
